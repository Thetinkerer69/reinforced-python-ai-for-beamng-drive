# BeamNG AI Racing Mod

A project to build an AI that can race in BeamNG.drive (and BeamMP) using Python and Lua mods.

---

## Overview

BeamNG.drive is an incredible driving simulator, but creating AI to race in it is challenging due to limited APIs and complex physics. This project provides:

- A Lua mod for BeamNG that exposes vehicle control and telemetry  
- A Python reinforcement learning environment that communicates with the mod  
- An example AI using Stable Baselines3 PPO algorithm to learn racing  

---

## Features

- Real-time vehicle state streaming from BeamNG to Python  
- Python sends control inputs (throttle, brake, steering) back to BeamNG  
- Supports single-player and multiplayer (BeamMP) environments  
- Easy to extend for custom vehicles and maps  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- BeamNG.drive with mod support  
- Python 3.8+  
- [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3)  
- Lua scripting knowledge (recommended)  

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beamng-ai-racing.git
   cd beamng-ai-racing
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy the Lua mod folder to BeamNG's mods directory.

Run BeamNG, enable the mod, and start the scenario.

Run the Python script to start training the AI:

bash
Copy
Edit
python beamng_racing_ai.py
